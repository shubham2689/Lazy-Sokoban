Format of custom input:

First line contains n which means you're going to enter an nXn matrix for yourself.
Next n lines contain the elements of each row of this matrix.
'.' represents floor
'D' represents destination(should be only one in number)
'X' represents wall
'S' represents sokoban player(should be only one in number)
'B' represents box

An example input which is meant for 8X8 matrix(after you enter 2, you can directly copy paste this on command line):
8
.......S
.DX.....
..X.X..X
..X.XX.X
..X.X...
.....XB.
..X.....
XXX.....

Note: You can create your own input matrix of size nXn and give custom input on the command line. Take care that there is some constraint on value of n: 3<=n<=8.
